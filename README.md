# Fraudulent-detection

1.Gather multiple and extensive datasets comprising Fraudulent activities from various sectors like banking transaction, ecommerce, healthcare, insurance, and finance.


2.Transform the datasets into suitable formats for training the AI model.


3. Various types of Phishing and how it is done: 

●Website spoofing :
Hackers create fake website that exactly duplicate the original website and if the users unknowingly give their personal information then the phishers will hack further

●Redirection or link manipulation:
 Hackers use various techniques to redirect users through sending phishing emails, compromised advertisements, manipulating search engine.

●data collection:
 If users visit fake websites, to themselves encourage losing their sensitive information like username, password, credit card details to the hackers.
 


4.To avoid this we try to implement the following:

■Create a notification or warning system that is activated when suspicious activity exceeds predetermined risk levels. The addition should offer thorough details on the hazards found and suggest suitable counter measures.

■Combination with Outside Fraud Databases: 
The extension should be integrated with external fraud databases and blacklists so that user information and transaction details may be cross-referenced. By lowering false positives and improving fraud detection accuracy, this feature aids in the identification of well-known scammers or dubious companies.

■MFA, or multi-factor authentication
 To reduce the danger of identity theft and unauthorised access, include MFA as a second layer of security. Depending on the needs of the system or platform, the extension should allow a variety of authentication techniques, such as SMS codes, email verification, biometrics, or hardware tokens.



5. LANGUAGE USED:

Python and R are commonly used programming languages for fraud detection. SQL is essential for querying transactional data from relational databases.

Apache Spark and Hadoop are distributed computing frameworks for processing large-scale data sets.

Machine learning and AI libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are used for building fraud detection models.

Data visualization tools like Tableau and matplotlib aid in exploring and visualizing fraud-related data.

Web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized for user interfaces and integration with web-based applications.

APIs (e.g., RESTful) and messaging protocols facilitate seamless communication between fraud detection systems and other applications or services.
